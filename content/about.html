  Thomas is an engineer with a diverse background unified
  by a common thread, robotics. While Thomas' formal 
  education was in mechanical engineering, his love for robotics

  continued learning through online courses, tinkering with new 
  technology, occasionally writing music, and hiking as often as possible! Thomas has
  demonstrated ability to adapt to his environment and grow from
  new challenges. This has lead Thomas to be a successful 
  engineer with Novus Labs as he is able to excel in a fast pace,
  dynamic workplace. Thomas is currently thrilled to be working

  open to new opportunities!
