<h3 class="text-left my-1"><u>About</u></h3>
<p>
  I am an engineer with a diverse background unified
  by a common thread, robotics. While my formal 
  education was in mechanical engineering, my love for robotics 
  has furthered my knowledge in electronics, computer science, 
  networking, and control theory. On my free time, I enjoy 
  continued learning through online courses, tinkering with new 
  technology, occasionally writing music, and hiking as often as possible! 
  I have demonstrated ability to adapt to my environment and grow 
  from new challenges. This has lead me to be a successful 
  engineer with Novus Labs as I am able to excel in a fast pace,
  dynamic workplace. I am currently thrilled to be working
  on a robotics project with Novus Labs and Cruise, but am always
  open to new opportunities!
