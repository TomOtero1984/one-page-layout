  <li><b>Stewart Platform:</b>
    Designed the circuitry and code for a parallel plate 6-DOF
    motion platform, commonly known as a Stewart Platform. This
    project made use of the closed chain kinematic equations found
    in the <a href="http://hades.mech.northwestern.edu/index.php/Modern_Robotics">
      Modern Robotics textbook</a>.
